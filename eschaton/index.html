<p class="serif" id="expl" style="margin-left:5em; margin-right:5em;">So what in the world is Eschaton? It's pretty much the most complicated tennis-based game ever thought up. David Foster Wallace wrote about the fictional game in his 1996 novel, <em>Infinite Jest</em>.<br>This javascript game is meant to act as a companion to the real world game, keeping track of in-game statistics and number keeping. This version would be considered bare-bones compared to what DFW wrote about, and draws from <a href="http://nowhereband.org/eschaton.html" STYLE="TEXT-DECORATION: NONE;">this Eschaton-lite guide</a>.</p>
<h1 class="serif" style="margin-left:2.5em;">Overview</h1>
<p class="serif"; id="expl" style="margin-left:5em; margin-right:5em;">Essentially it is a cold-war simulation that almost always ends in chaos. Players, also known as Heads of State, take charge of alliances of countries. The five in this game are: <b>AMNAT</b>: America and NATO nations; <b>SOVWAR</b>: The Soviet Union and members of the Warsaw Pact; <b>INDPAK</b>: India and Pakistan; <b>IRLYBSIR</b>: Israel, Lybia, and Syria; and <b>REDCHI</b>: China.<br>The game is to take place on several adjacent tennis courts that make up a map of the northern hemisphere. Each team will use clothing to represent strategic military points. For our purposes, this will be made up of 10 Major Metropolitan Areas (MAMAs) and 5 shoes that can be moved and used as nuclear submarines from which players may attack hostile nations. Each MAMA contains 250,000 civilians, and for the purpose of Eschaton-lite, protecting them and destroying other countries' MAMAs and submarines is the main objective.<br>The five teams fall under either the Western or Eastern Blocs, with only AMNAT and SOVWAR committed to their side, respectively. The remaining nations are free agents and can make alliances accordingly. However, joining a side means casting your nation's fate with the entire Bloc's, so choose wisely.<br><br>Again, this is simply a brief overview of Eschaton. Be sure to check out <a href="http://nowhereband.org/eschaton.html" STYLE="TEXT-DECORATION: NONE;">the rule book</a> for more details! </p>
