For your consideration: Cover letter for the position of revenue Intern

My name is Jack McGrath, and I’m a student at UNC. I spend a lot of time reading and on the internet. I’ve been following the Outline for the past couple of months and the site and the team seem absolutely fantastic. I want to help build it. 

During my two summers as the customer experience (CX) intern at Airbnb, 

What if you were an alien who had no knowledge of the way web advertising works. What would you come up with? Is there such a thing as an advertising mechanism that customers don’t loathe?

Here’s why I’m interested in revenue: it’s a hard problem with no single solution, but doing it right allows you freedom to pursue greater challenges. 
It seems that many publications treat advertising as an afterthought, which makes sense, because no one gets into this business to advertise. But this mentality creates jarring, unpleasant experiences that detract from the impact of the article and the effectiveness of the ads. 
I see it as both a means and an end. No major publication has really gotten it right, and I love the idea of solving a problem that’s killing the Wall Street Journal. More importantly, it allows journalistic freedom. 
Advertising is seen as a necessary evil.
How does an indie media company with the tagline “It’s not for everyone. It’s for you.” pay rent and salaries in Manhattan?  I’m also interested in the context of The Outline’s revenue. Cadillac, the maker of the President’s Armored limo, is proud to partner with a media company that will tap dance with cleats on him. It’s weird and unsurprising. 

So there seem to be two traditional sources of revenue: subscribers and proud partners. It’s worth considering who frequents The Outline. My guess is well-educated left-leaning young people.

Alien Ideas:
Expose global NSA surveillance; live rent-free in Moscow. 
Monthly Franzen op-ed to attract wealthy white male subscribers.
Send Cease & Desists to every website that contains the phrase “the outline.”
Auto-playing video ads.

Convincing individuals to pay for access requires a high burden of proof that it’s worth it.
